/* Alright so the goal of this is to create the part of the project that will have 
(probably) the most story branch points, based on how the components are interacted 
with (some lines, beziers, and text, let's say. different colors, too)

i will not create the links to the story branches they lead to just yet, bcause that 
would be too much work, so i'll put a placeholder shape (a yellow square i guess) in
the corner of the window to indicate when the interactor would have been locked into 
a story branch

mouse input is still the main mechanic in this
